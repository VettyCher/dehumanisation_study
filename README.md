Resources developed for the study of online dehumanization, focusing on the analysis of the most popular Telegram channels in Russia and Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Contains dictionaries for regex classification of posts by Russian and Ukrainian Telegram channels as discussing respective ingroup and outgroup.

For both countries there is a set of dictionaries containing:
1. formal identifiers (e.g. 'Zelensky' or ‘Kremlin’)
2. positional identifiers (e.g. ‘enemy’)
3. derogatory/dehumanising identifiers (e.g. 'Ukrafashists' or ‘ork’)
4. Discussion of occupied territories and disputed topics (e.g. ‘Donbass')

Almost each of these dictionaries works with precision and recall of at least 95%. The only exclusion is the positional keywords dictionary for Russian Telegram (gives 90% precision). Estimation was done based on randomly chosen 100 posts classified as ‘positive' and 100 classified as ‘negative’.
